#### Design brief:

The design brief below is in refrence to the wireframe design board in Miro

Colour:
I made the number button a different colour from the operation buttons so they are easily distinguishable from each other.
The text is a darker colour so it stands out from the buttons and is easy to read.

Buttons: 
I only used simple operations because younger kids may not understand or have a use for more complex operations.
I made the clear button bigger and place it at the bottom of the screen so it isn't acidentily pressed 

operation signs:
The operation signs are basic mathmatical operations instead of one used for typing (ร instead of * and รท insteead of /)
