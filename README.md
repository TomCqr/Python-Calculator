Colour:
- I made the number buttons a different colour from the operation buttons so they are easily distinguishable from each other.<br>
- The text is a darker colour so it stands out from the buttons and is easy to read.<br>

Buttons:
- I only used simple operations because younger kids may not understand or have a use for more complex operations.<br>
- I made the clear button bigger and place it at the bottom of the screen so it isn't acidentily pressed<br> 
- The Addition button it larger as it would be the most commonly used operator for primany aged kids<br>
- The buttons have a bevel to soften the corners and to make it easier to distinguish the buttons from eachother<br> 

Operation signs:
- The operation signs are basic mathmatical operations instead of one used for typing (× instead of * and ÷ insteead of /)<br?
