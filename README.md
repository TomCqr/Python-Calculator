# Customised Python Calculator

### About my Project
This calculator is intented for primary schoold aged kids (8-11 years)

* Colour:
 * I chose to use light blues for the number and darker blue for the operation button to make them stand out

Buttons:
 * I only used simple operations because younger kids may not understand or have a use for more complex operations.<br>
- I made the clear button bigger and place it at the bottom of the screen so it isn't acidentily pressed<br> 
- The Addition button it larger as it would be the most commonly used operator for primany aged kids<br>
- The buttons have a bevel to soften the corners and to make it easier to distinguish the buttons from eachother<br> 

Operation signs:
- The operation signs are basic mathmatical operations instead of one used for typing (ร instead of * and รท insteead of /)<br?

## The design
* Colour
  * The colours I have chosen for the calculator is taken from my design for the age group
  * The website that I used for this is [**Matplolib.org**](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/color/named_colors.html)
  
* Layout
  * Here's a link to my design in Miro: [**Miro.com**](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPUK4jBY=/)<br>
